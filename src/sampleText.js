## Sub-headings

### Smaller headings

Here's some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function example(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`

Make your text **bold**!
Or _italic_.
Or... **_both!_**
And feel free to ~~cross text out~~.
